name: dev-diff
description: Fast-forwards local main from origin/main (without switching away from whatever branch is currently checked out) and reports how dev currently differs from it — commits ahead each direction, and the number and names of files that differ, counted the way CodeRabbit counts them. Use for "how far ahead is dev", "diff main and dev", "how many files differ between dev and main".

# dev-diff

Read-only reporting. Runs `dev-diff.sh`, which fast-forwards local `main` and
reports how `dev` and `main` currently differ, scoped to what CodeRabbit
actually reviews (it reads `.coderabbit.yaml`'s `reviews.path_filters`
exclusions — `package-lock.json`, generated sqlc code, `.claude/**`,
`.agents/**`, build output — and headlines the count that's left, since that's
what CodeRabbit's 100-file cap applies to). Makes no commits, opens no PR, and
never leaves the maintainer on a different branch than the one they started on.

## Hard constraints

- Never `checkout`, `reset --hard`, `merge`, or anything `--force`. The script
  only ever fetches, ff-only-pulls/fetches `main`, and diffs — it never touches
  `dev`'s ref.
- Don't re-run the git commands the script already ran, and don't add your own
  extra `git diff`/`git log` calls on top of it — the script is the single
  source of truth for this report.
- It needs `python3` with PyYAML to read `.coderabbit.yaml`; without them it
  refuses rather than over-count.

## `--list` mode

`dev-diff.sh --list` is for scripts, not for this skill's report: it prints only
the reviewable paths of the `main...dev` diff, one per line, after the same
fetch, fast-forward and `path_filters` exclusion logic. Errors and notices go to
stderr, with the same non-zero exits (unclean tree, `main` diverged); with no
local `dev` branch it prints nothing and exits 0. `orchestrate` uses it to
budget the 100-file cap.

## Steps

1. Run `.claude/skills/dev-diff/dev-diff.sh` (no arguments).
2. If it exits non-zero (unclean working tree, or `main` diverged from
   `origin/main`), report the exact error line(s) it printed and stop — don't
   attempt a fix yourself.
3. If it printed "No local 'dev' branch exists", report that and stop.
4. Otherwise, relay its output **verbatim, unmodified** as the whole answer —
   headline the `FILES REVIEWABLE BY CODERABBIT` and `PRs needed at 100-file
   cap` lines since that's what scoping a PR depends on. Do not re-derive,
   re-summarize, or add narration around it.
